### Setup
1. Install dependencies.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your database url.
3. Run `pnpm dlx prisma db push` to push changes to db and generate prisma client.
4. Todo CRUD should be working now.

This app is a very basic example implementing CRUD app in next.js. There are many thing that can be improved, but that is not the purpose of this repo.
